_R is applied._         
_Some projects involved statistical computing and modeling._            
##1. Race Times - The Cherry Blossom Run:               
This project involves reading data into R from a slightly non-standard format, exploring it (both numerically and graphically), identifying possible errors, summarizing the data, and finding and communicating aspects of interest. As part of the work, the project worked on matching individuals across years to create longitudinal data.    
##2. Bihman-Middleton-Levin Traffic Model Simulationï¼š    
This project has three purpose.One is writing good, flexible, reusable R functions and testing them to verify they are correct. The second topic is to use the S3 class mechanism to define classes and methods for printing and plotting objects representing the simulation. The third element is to make the code efficient, e.g., by profiling and using different computational approaches. The final aspect is to create an R package containing my code, help files and anything else.    
##3. BML in C:    
Almost same to 2, but in this project, I complete the simulation in C. Also added the C part in the package.
##4. Working with "Big Data":
In this project, it was going to work with the New York taxi data.     
These are available http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/.
And there is a description of the fields at http://publish.illinois.edu/dbwork/open-data/ .
I tried R, PYTHON, SHELL, C++ on the project. Also played around little about mapreduce.
