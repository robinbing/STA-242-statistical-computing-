# STA-242-statistical-computing-
R is applied.

Some projects involved statistical computing and modeling.

1. Race Times - The Cherry Blossom Run:
This project involves reading data into R from a slightly non-standard format, exploring it (both numerically and graphically), identifying possible errors, summarizing the data, and finding and communicating aspects of interest. As part of the work, the project worked on matching individuals across years to create longitudinal data.
